<h1>Lossless and Lossy Image</h1>

<h2>The Difference Between lossy and Lossless Compression on Images</h2>
<p>Lossy compression is when information of the original file is removed/deleted for good and can't be taken back. lossless compression is the opposite, it keeps all the information and data that was originally in the file. This explains why lossy formats are a smaller size than lossless formats.
<br></br> 

<h2>Why is it important for web designers to compress image files?</h2> 
<p>It is important for web designers to compress images to as high quality image they can get for the smallest file size so that the website doesn't take long to load. research has found that websites that take time to load have people spend time on it less, click on through things less, click less ads and therefore spend less. Smaller file size images on websites take in more money and have more people access them. So web designers have to make sure that the quality of images is good enough but not take time to load so that people stay on their website.</p>
<br></br> 

<h2>The effects of lossy and lossless compression</h2>
<p>Lossless compression doesn't do much to the picture, while the picture may look the same, a lot of pixels have slightly changed, though the viewer will probably not notice it. Lossy compression takes the certain data from the image causing the image to decrease in quality, look blurrier.</p>
