<body> 

<h3>Lossless Audio Files</h3>

<h2>Examples of Lossless File Types</h2> 

<ul>
<li><strong>FLAC</strong></li> 
<p>FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. It is a high quality audio format but has a large size.</p>

<li><strong>WAV</strong></li>
<p>WAV is short for WAVeform Audio Format. It is an uncompressed audio format that not many people use any more because of the development of better lossless audio formats such as FLAC.</p>

<li><strong>ALAC</strong></li>
<P>ALAC stands for Apple Lossless Audio Codec. It is an Apple made lossless audio format that stores a song without losing any of the detail in it. It is a high quality audio format but take up a lot of storage space as it is a large file. It would also be almost useless to someone if they are using basic earphones or speakers as they probably won't be able to hear the difference in quality.</p>
</ul>
<br></br>
<h2>Why Use Lossless File Formats?</h2> 
<p>If you are looking for high quality music/sound then lossless audio formats are the best option because they produce a much more clearer and more detailed sound. Though again, you must have a higher quality earphone or speaker to be able to hear the difference in the audio quality</p>

<br></br>
<h3>Lossy Audio Formats</h3> 
<h2>Examples Of Lossy Audio Formats</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>MP3</strong></li>
<p>MP3 audio is made by reducing certain components of sound in the audio that is considered to be sounds that humans wouldn't be able to hear.</p>

<li><strong>Vorbis</strong></li>
<p>Vorbis is a lossy audio format that is considered by some to have the highest quality sound even though it has a small file size.</p>
</ul>
<br></br>
<h2>How Does Lossy Compression Work</h2>
<p>Lossy compression works by permanently deleting certain information in the file,especially information that is unnecessary.</p>
<br></br>
<h2>Why Use Lossy File Formats</h2>
<p>Lossy formats a great if you just want to listen to music on you phone, and don't mind if the quality isn't the highest as the file doesn't take up much storage space because of the compression. you will also be able to download more songs because of the small files.</p>
